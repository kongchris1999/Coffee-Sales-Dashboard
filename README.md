# Coffee-Sales-Dashboard
I built this interactive Excel dashboard to analyze six months of coffee sales data across three NYC locations. It highlights peak sales hours, top-performing products, and trends by weekday and product category. I used slicers, pivot tables, and dynamic visuals to uncover operational insights and make recommendations around staffing, inventory, and promotions.
